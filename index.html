   <p>Hi,
   my name is Fatima Aminu, I'm a northerner who is passionate about design. I get my inspiration from friends, family and resources online.
   I am currently enrolled in a design school sponsored by GIZ and powered by CodeTutor. My experience has been nothing short of educating and interesting.
   My instructor has been able to walk me through the steps of getting a simple, yet communicative design. <a href="./work.html">Click</a> to see what I've been able to put together in the span of five weeks thus far. 
  <br> Feel free to connect with me, let me know what your thoughts are, or perhaps a comment you wish to drop. <i>teemahbae@gmail.com </i>  </p>
